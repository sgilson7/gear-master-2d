# CLAUDE.md — operating notes

Kept current. If something here is out of date it is a bug in this file.

## What this is

A 2D tile-based open-world RPG built on the gear-assembly auto-battler forked
from `sgilson7/gear-master`. `PLANNING-BRIEF.md` is the brief; `PLAN.md` is the
plan and **wins where the two disagree**; `TONE.md` governs every string a
player reads.

**Milestone: M0 complete. Deploy gate 1 is live** at
<https://sgilson7.github.io/gear-master-2d/> — the page loads the wasm and
answers `core: 523 pieces`. M1 has not started.

## Rules

- `crates/core` never imports `wasm-bindgen`, `web-sys`, or anything
  DOM-shaped. If you are reaching for one, stop.
- `crates/wasm` is a shim. It moves strings across the boundary and decides
  nothing. A rule decided there is a rule the test suite cannot reach in
  seconds, and then there are two rulebooks.
- Content lives in `data/*.json`. **If you are editing a `.rs` file to change
  what a player reads, you are in the wrong file.**
- Never write a game string without `TONE.md` open.
- Save round-trip tests run on every commit from M1. A red round-trip blocks
  everything.
- **The agent does not run `git push` or `make publish`.** Only a human
  deploys. (The one exception was the repo's creation and first push, which the
  human asked for explicitly. The rule is back in force.)
- Do not start a milestone before the previous gate is live and the human has
  seen it.

## Commands

    make test          # the engine suite, native, seconds
    make check         # fast type-check
    make web           # build dist/web/
    make test-ui       # drive the built page in a real browser
    make serve         # build and open locally
    make test-ui-setup # one-time: venv + headless chromium

Rebaseline the golden combat fixture, and say in the commit what started
fighting differently:

    REBASELINE_GOLDEN_COMBAT=1 cargo test -p gm2d-core

## Divergences from the brief

`PLAN.md` wins. These are the places it does, and why.

| # | Divergence | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Fork by copy with a provenance file, not a git subtree. And the campaign is dropped, not carried: eleven modules deleted, `Run` replaced by `Character`. | `PLAN.md` 1.1, `crates/core/UPSTREAM` |
| 1.7 | §C.1 is a **design change, not a bug fix**. Upstream paid the bounty on a loss deliberately and its reasoning was sound *on a ladder*. GM2D is not a corridor, so the justification goes and the exploit stays. | `crates/core/src/reward.rs` |
| 1.9 | The theme becomes data. `theme.rs` already treats a name as a key rather than a label; moving its tables to `data/` is where they belong. | `PLAN.md` 1.9 |
| 1.10 | Actions builds and publishes to Pages. No `docs/`, no human-run `make publish` rebuild. The brief described gear-master, which predates both house web repos and ships macroquad. | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |

Also true, and not in the brief because it could not have been:

- **§C.1's code was gone before the fix was written.** The bounty was paid in
  `Run::settle`, which left with the campaign. The rule now lives in
  `reward.rs` and M3's encounter resolution calls it.
- **§C.3 is not a code fix.** It was a fault in a CLI GM2D does not ship. It
  survives as a UI rule: **the shop screen displays the price actually
  charged, never `registry.def(id).price`.** It becomes a test in M3.

## Things the fork learned the expensive way

Three facts about the engine that are invisible until they cost you a day. All
three were found by the golden fixture in M0, and all three are fields M1's
save file has to carry.

1. **`Loadout::locks` is state, not geometry.** Two pieces that touch are one
   item unless a lock says otherwise, and which locks exist depends on the
   order the player built in. Re-deriving them gives a different board: the
   first fixture rebuild came back with more items than it went in with.
2. **`Loadout::name_seed` seeds the name hash.** Drop it and every stat
   survives a round trip while every item is renamed — "Resonant Sliver" comes
   back as "Resonant Thorn" and nothing else looks wrong.
3. **`PieceId` is an index into `PieceRegistry`.** The registry is saved whole
   and in order, by canonical catalogue *name* — never by catalogue index,
   which is only stable while catalogue order is.

And one from upstream, inherited deliberately: **lock each item as it
assembles, not once at the end.** A finished board is packed to within a cell
or two of full, so deriving items in a single pass at the end asks which pieces
are connected and gets "most of them". `share.rs` learned this when nineteen
weapon pieces came back as one item.

## Inherited on purpose — do not "simplify"

No RNG in combat. 50 ms ticks. Monsters are loadouts wearing catalogue pieces.
The naming system. These are the reason to keep the engine.

## Deleted, and where to find it

Eleven modules and 57 test files went in `48203ee`. Everything is in the
history at `78e40eb` if a question about the old behaviour needs answering.

Dropped modules: `county`, `dungeon`, `route`, `quest`, `relic`, `pedestal`,
`rumour`, `bestiary`, `town`, `share`, `run`.

Dropped tests, all of them testing something GM2D no longer does — fountains
and axis thresholds, the road, receipts and choices, share codes — or leaning
on a helper that does: `packing`, `validity`, `classes`, `casino`, `chain`,
`francis`, `phase_two`, `prose`, `structures`, `two_voices`, `insight`,
`tallies`, `vip`, `completable`, `two_runs`, `taller_boards`, `sudden_death`,
`fight`, `reference_builds`, and the campaign half of `tooltips`.

Four classes went with the dungeons that were their only source: `Ascendant`,
`Threshold-Sighted`, `Prospector`, `Wumpus Hunter`. Their `ClassPower`s survive
and M5's trees may spend them again.

`CLASS_ORDER` and its append-only test were the share-code wire format.
`share.rs` is gone, so the constraint is gone.

## Numbers, so a regression is visible

| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream suite, pristine fork | 1075 passing |
| After the campaign was cut | 128 passing |
| After the simulation tests were ported to `Character` | 329 passing |
| Catalogue | 523 components |
| Ladder | 50 creatures |
| `crates/core` | ~33k lines, down from ~50k |
| wasm | 346 KB |

Note the catalogue is **523**, not the 374 the retheme document counts — it
grew upstream after that document was written. Any content work that quotes a
catalogue size should quote this one.

## Open questions the human has not answered

Listed in `PLAN.md` §6. None block M1.

**Answered:** the repo is `sgilson7/gear-master-2d`, public, Pages served from
Actions.

**Still open**, with the default in force: losing costs nothing but the walk
back; the content charter is binding; invented proper nouns fail the M2 lint;
`quest.rs` and `town.rs` stay dropped.
