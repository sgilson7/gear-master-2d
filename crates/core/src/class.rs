//! Classes, read off the build rather than chosen.
//!
//! # The rule that makes this extensible
//!
//! **No class definition may ever name a component.** A class is a set of
//! minimum values on abstract axes, and every axis is measured by summing
//! properties that every component already has - its slot, its kind, its
//! stats, its triggers. A new component moves the axes it happens to touch
//! and no class definition changes.
//!
//! That is the whole trick. Writing "Chronomancer needs a Scrying Orb" would
//! mean revisiting Chronomancer every time an orb is added; writing
//! "Chronomancer needs Orbits >= 45 and MagicChest >= 40" means new orbs and
//! new magical chestpieces feed it automatically, and a component that is
//! removed simply stops contributing.
//!
//! Axes are normalised 0-100 against a reference build, so thresholds keep
//! meaning the same thing as the catalogue grows. They are deliberately
//! forgiving at the top: a build far past a threshold reads 100, so piling on
//! more of the same never silently disqualifies you from a class you already
//! matched.
