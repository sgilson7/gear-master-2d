    // ---- THE SWITCHYARD -------------------------------------------------
    //
    // `design/the-switchyard.md` A6. Eight components in one block at the end
    // of the list, appended and never inserted, because a share code stores a
    // piece as its *position* here and anything else silently re-points every
    // board anybody has saved.
    //
    // All eight are event-only, and that is what makes the block safe to land
    // a milestone ahead of the content that hands it out: `stepped_component`
    // filters event-only pieces out of every footprint family, so no creature
    // can be re-dressed by their arrival on any difficulty. The measurement of
    // that sentence is `catalog_shape::no_creature_changed_what_it_wears`,
    // which compares all 5,568 placements against a fixture taken at M0.
    //
    // The four enchantments are dug up rather than sold. `is_town_stock` is
    // still true of them - they are enchantments - so `shop.rs` keeps them off
    // the road three separate ways; what changed is `town_shelf`, which now
    // filters event-only out of the enchantment half, because collecting by
    // kind would otherwise have put a rung-27 dungeon's reward on every town
    // cart in the game the day it was written.
    //
    // Each carries two payouts read on two layers, which is the enchantment
    // mechanic as it already stands: the `effect` is what it is worth while
    // merely *live*, and scales with whatever is standing on it; the
    // `triggers` are what it hands to an item that covers every one of its
    // cells and *bonds*. Live wants them spread out, bonded wants gear packed
    // tight, and the two halves are meant to fight.
