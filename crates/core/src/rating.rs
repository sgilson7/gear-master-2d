//! How good is a piece of gear, in one number.
//!
//! Everything a component does falls into one of two shapes:
//!
//!   * a **standing** benefit - health, strength, regen, power, resistances.
//!     You have it for the whole fight whatever the item's cooldown is.
//!   * a **per-activation** benefit - damage, armour, mana, mind, and every
//!     trigger. You get it once each time the item goes off.
//!
//! The second kind is worthless without knowing how often the item fires, so
//! everything is converted to a per-second figure and added up. A chestpiece
//! granting 20 armour every 4 seconds and one granting 5 every second are the
//! same rating, which is the point: the number is meant to survive comparing
//! a weapon against a pair of greaves.
//!
//! The result is deliberately coarse. It drives a rarity badge, not a
//! simulation - the combat engine remains the authority on what actually
//! happens in a fight.
