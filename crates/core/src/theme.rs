//! Words, swapped wholesale.
//!
//! # Why this is a layer rather than a rewrite
//!
//! Every name the engine works with - `"Oak Handle"`, `"Cave Rat"` - is a
//! **key**, not a label. Recipes, monster loadouts, quest targets and the whole
//! test suite are string-keyed on those names, and renaming them in place
//! would mean editing all of it at once and hoping. So nothing here changes
//! what anything is *called* in the code; a theme is a lookup from the
//! canonical name to the one on screen.
//!
//! The consequence worth stating: **a theme cannot break the game.** A missing
//! entry falls through to the canonical name, so a half-finished theme is a
//! game with some untranslated words in it rather than a game that does not
//! start. The engine never reads a themed string back.
//!
//! Adding a theme is adding one `Theme` to `THEMES`. Nothing else has to know.
