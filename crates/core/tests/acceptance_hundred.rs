//! THE HUNDRED's eleven acceptance criteria, one test apiece.
//!
//! F14. `acceptance.rs` is the Unwinding's and the Switchyard's; this is this
//! mission's, kept apart for the reason those two are kept together - a
//! criterion is a promise a *mission* made, and reading eleven of them in one
//! file is how you find out whether it was kept.
//!
//! Where a criterion could not be met as written, the test says so in its own
//! assertion and the measurement that refused it is named. Two were: **6**,
//! which is calibrated against a board that cannot do it for anything at these
//! bands, and **3 and 4**, whose figures were arithmetic off a paper map.
