//! Assembly bonuses that do something, and the wiring that carries them.
//!
//! M2 added `AssemblyBonus::triggers` and said plainly that it could not prove
//! the wiring: `CATALOG` is static, so a test cannot invent a piece carrying
//! one, and no shipped piece did. This file is that proof. Each test below
//! fails if the trigger never reaches the fight, which is the only way to know
//! the field is connected rather than merely declared.
//!
//! The four here are the ones that cost no new combat code - they are built
//! from triggers the game already had. Three of them exercise machinery that
//! was reachable in principle and by nothing in practice.
