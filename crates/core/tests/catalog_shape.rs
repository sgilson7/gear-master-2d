//! The five slots keep their shapes.
//!
//! `rating.rs` pins the rarity curve so a batch of new components cannot
//! quietly make everything legendary. This is the same idea aimed at identity:
//! so a batch of new components cannot quietly dissolve a slot back into a stat
//! pile. Each slot is meant to answer one question - weapon conversion, gloves
//! reaction, greaves tempo, chest reserve, helmet economy - and the rules below
//! are what "meant to" cashes out as.
//!
//! **How this file is red.** The spec asks for a test written red and made
//! green by the sweep. A suite that stays red for eight pull requests is not a
//! safety net, though - it is a light nobody looks at, and the sweep needs a
//! green suite to notice what it breaks. So the rules carry two numbers each: a
//! `budget`, which is how far the catalogue misses today, and a `target`, which
//! is where the rewrite has to get it. The default test asserts the budget and
//! is **green**; it can only ever be tightened, so a new off-axis piece fails it
//! immediately. `the_catalog_keeps_every_rule` asserts the targets, is
//! **ignored and red**, and is the one the sweep is finished by:
//!
//!     cargo test -p gm2d-core --test catalog_shape -- --ignored --nocapture
//!
//! Lower a budget in the same commit that earns it, the way this repo re-pins
//! anything else. Never raise one.
//!
//! **Floating kinds.** `PieceDef::fits` lets a Material sit in gloves or
//! greaves and a Plating in helmet or greaves - 61 pieces that can be placed
//! outside the slot they were written for. A rule keyed on `def.slot` therefore
//! cannot promise a mechanic stays in its grid, only that it was authored
//! there. So the two floating kinds are barred from carrying identity mechanics
//! at all (`identity_carriers`), which is what makes the rest of the table mean
//! something on the board rather than only in the source. They are the bleed
//! carriers: deliberately neutral, deliberately shared.

/// and Insane without touching a line of any monster's own table
/// (`the-unwinding.md` #19). Medium is gear-as-written and is dumped too, so
/// the fixture is the whole of what a creature fights in.

/// fixture is for, because a catalogue that grew by eight components between
/// M0 and M9 had eight chances to re-sort a footprint family underneath
/// somebody nobody was editing.
/// **Re-baselined at THE HUNDRED's F12**, and it is the second legitimate one.
/// The fixture grew from 6,216 placements to **6,744** and **nothing was
/// removed**: all 528 new lines belong to THE SURVEYOR, THE DROVER, THE
/// DRIVEN, THE COMMISSIONER and THE PARISH, who had no board until that
/// milestone borrowed one for each of them. No creature that had a board
