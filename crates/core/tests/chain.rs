//! The Unwinding: four stations, two hidden towns, and a thing at the end.
//!
//! What makes this a chain rather than four events on four rungs is that each
//! station is *reached* by the last one. What makes it a chain somebody can
//! finish is that every station **fails forward**: a refused choice costs the
//! reward and never the road. There is exactly one thing on it that can be
//! lost rather than declined, and even that waits three rungs and offers
//! again.
//!
//! The chain's state is mostly not a flag. It is the **words you are
//! carrying**, the towns you have been told about, and one dungeon cleared -
//! all of which are things the run already knew how to remember. Only the
//! antechamber sets a flag, because a dungeon is the one station whose being
//! finished is not visible in your tray.
