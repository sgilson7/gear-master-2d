//! Every door can be reached, opened, and walked through.
//!
//! Three bugs of one shape got this file written, and all three survived a
//! fully green suite because every test was asking the wrong half of the
//! question.
//!
//! - **THE BIGGER SIGN** stood on rung 41 and revealed a town standing after
//!   rung 14. Something *did* reveal it. Nothing asked whether the reveal
//!   could happen in time.
//! - **THE FOUNDRY REMEMBERS** wanted two crucible melts. A town is one visit
//!   and one action, the only second action in the game is the Second Key, and
//!   the key's only source stands at or after the Slagworks' own gate. Two was
//!   a number no run could reach.
//! - **THE PICKET LINE** opens on a word handed out at rung 20 and advertised
//!   a window from rung 13.
//!
//! So the rule this file enforces: for every door, work out the **earliest
//! rung it can possibly be answered on**, and check that everything it depends
//! on can happen at or before that. A dependency that arrives after the window
//! shuts is content nobody will ever see, and it looks exactly like content
//! that works.
