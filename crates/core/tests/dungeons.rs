/// Every shipped dungeon says and does exactly what it said and did at M0.

/// The fixture is `analysis/replays/dungeons.txt`. M1 rewrote the floor tables,
/// moved the landings into them, changed how a landing is looked up in the
/// theme, and rewrote the map's node - and none of it is allowed to change one
/// character of what a run walking a straight line is told. That is the whole
/// of what "landed inert" means, and it is a diff rather than an argument.
///
/// Re-baseline with `REBASELINE_DUNGEON_REPLAY=1`, and say in the commit which
/// dungeon started saying something else.
///
/// **Re-baselined once, at M2**, and the diff was fourteen banner lines and
/// nothing else: every one gained the creature's name between the dungeon's
/// and the floor count, which is what acceptance criterion 3 asks for in those
/// words. Every `floor {n} of {m}` pair came back the same, which is the half
/// of the banner that had to hold when its two numbers changed meaning.
