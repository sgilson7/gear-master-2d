//! Events that turn up because of something you did.
//!
//! A scheduled event is easy to be sure of: it is on rung fifteen or it is a
//! bug. An earned one has a window and a condition, and the failure that
//! matters is the quiet one - a condition nothing can ever satisfy, so the
//! event simply never happens and nobody can tell it was meant to.
