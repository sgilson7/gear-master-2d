//! Enchantments: pieces that lie under the grid instead of in it.
//!
//! An enchantment is the one thing on a board that gear may stand on. The rules
//! are deliberately narrow - it is always loose, it never overlaps another
//! enchantment, it is one layer deep, and it can never join or merge an item -
//! and this is where each of those is held to.
//!
//! Two conditions decide what one is worth, and they pull opposite ways.
//! **Live** is read on the enchantment layer: nothing else on that layer may
//! touch it, so enchantments want spreading out. **Bonded** is read on the gear
//! layer: one item must cover every one of its cells, so gear wants packing
//! tight and shaped to fit. A bonded item is doubled and handed a trigger.
//!
//! It was called enchantment, which was the wrong word for four grids out of five.
//! Only the greaves have ground under them.
