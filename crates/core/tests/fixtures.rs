//! Pieces the test suite leans on, and what it leans on them for.
//!
//! Eleven tests across five files name a component as their example of a
//! mechanic: `effects` needs something that opens a fight, `drains` needs
//! something that takes a pool, `curses_in_combat` needs something that banks
//! empowerment. When the rewrite moves a mechanic to its proper slot, those
//! pieces stop carrying it and the tests fail — five times so far, and each
//! time the failure landed in a file with no obvious connection to the change.
//!
//! The obvious fix does not work. Those fixtures do not merely name a piece,
//! they *place* it: `equip(&mut run, "Braced Plating", SlotKind::Helmet, 0, 2)`
//! puts a specific polyomino at specific cells. Looking one up by mechanic
//! would hand back a shape the coordinates do not fit, so the coupling is real
//! and cannot be abstracted away.
//!
//! So it is declared instead. Each row below says "this test needs this piece
//! to keep doing this", and the sweep that takes the mechanic away fails
//! *here*, with the name of the test it is about to break, rather than
//! somewhere downstream. That turns a debugging session into a line of output.
//!
//! **This is not a reason to keep a mechanic in the wrong slot.** When a sweep
//! moves one of these, the answer is to fix the test it names — give the
//! fixture a piece that still carries what it needs, and re-pin the
//! coordinates for the new shape — and then delete the row. A shrinking table
//! is the point.
