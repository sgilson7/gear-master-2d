//! Francis was on thirty-six percent of his cells with one item a slot. That
//! is not a hard fight, it is four fifths of an empty board: the two finished
//! human boards in `share` pack ninety-seven and ninety-eight percent, and the
//! stronger of them took him on Hard in nine and a half seconds.
//!
//! He is packed by `tests/pack_francis.rs`, which is a generator rather than a
//! check. What this file does is hold the result: density, shape, and the
//! outcome against both boards, so a later change to gear or to the rating
//! curve cannot quietly hand him back.
