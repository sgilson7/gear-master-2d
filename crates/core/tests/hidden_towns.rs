//! Towns that are not on the map until something puts them there.
//!
//! A pinned town is furniture: it is on the road before the run starts and it
//! is on the road for everybody. A hidden one is somewhere you were *told
//! about* - and after that it is a town in every other respect, standing at
//! its own rung, subject to the one-visit rule, paying the bounty again if you
//! walk past.
//!
//! Two things this file exists to hold still. The three shipped towns must be
//! byte-identical through the migration - E6 criterion 2 asks for their tests
//! unmodified and this is the same claim said from the other side. And a town
//! now carries its own doors, because a hidden town is hidden by being
//! somewhere else, and somewhere else has a crucible rather than a chapel.
