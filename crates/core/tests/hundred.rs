// somewhere a run can actually stand, and is every county event somewhere a
// run can actually be asked?
//

// tolls: could any run get there at all. **Met** is play: does a run walking
// its ten trips actually end up there. The first is a property of the county
// and is asserted here; the second is a property of a *player* and is
// measured rather than asserted, because a walker that plays badly proves
// nothing about a county.

/// Five moves from six gates and the gaol covers all forty-nine tiles.
///
/// The county's own V7 promises every tile is within **eight** moves of a
/// mouth, and a trip is **five** - so V7 does not say this and nothing did
/// until now. What makes it true is the gaol: C1 puts a run down within three
/// of the centre, and the centre is what five moves from an edge cannot

// ------------------------------------------------ T0: a state nothing drew

// their own. Walking onto a pinnacle calls `begin_county_fight`, which runs
// the whole simulation and leaves `Phase::Fighting`. The interface never built
// a playback from it, so nothing advanced and nothing settled. And both
// `county_walk` and `leave_county` refuse while the phase is not `Loadout`,
// so every control died at once.
//
// The engine half of the fix is that a won chain leaves you on the map. The
// test below is the *general* form of what went wrong, which is worth more
// than a test for the Drover: a run that reaches a state no screen draws is
// stuck there whatever put it in one.

/// Every state a county trip can reach is one some screen will draw.
///
/// `Phase::Fighting` with `county_at` set was the state nothing drew - the
/// battle screen is skipped while the county map is up, and the county map
/// refuses every control while a fight is unsettled. So the pairing itself is
/// what this asserts against, without needing a graphics context to do it.
