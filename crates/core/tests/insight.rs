//! The third lane's pool, and the fact that nothing can reach it yet.
//!
//! Insight is the eighth resource and it is deliberately the strangest one.
//! Three of the eight are fusions, which nothing spends; four are the pools a
//! trigger may ask for. Insight is neither. It is **fuel**, on exactly mana's
//! terms - holding it pays nothing at all, and what it is worth depends
//! entirely on the stacks standing on it - and it is the only resource in the
//! game a run has to be *given* before it exists.
//!
//! This file is mostly about that second half. The mechanic ships whole and
//! dark: `Run::insight_unlocked` is false, `Shop::insight_open` is false, and
//! no component in the catalogue banks a point of it. The Insight gear family
//! arrives with the rest of the mission's catalogue (M9) and the tests below
//! that read `CATALOG` are written to become real on the day it does rather
//! than to be rewritten then.
