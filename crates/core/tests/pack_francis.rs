//! A packing search, run by hand to author a creature's boards.
//!
//! Ignored by default: it is a generator, not a check. `cargo test -p
//! gm2d-core --test pack_francis -- --ignored --nocapture` prints a
//! `gear` and `items` list to paste into `combat.rs`.
//!
//! Why it exists: the two finished human boards in `share` pack ninety-seven
//! and ninety-eight percent of their cells, and Francis - the last thing on
//! the ladder - was at thirty-six, with one item per slot. He was not losing
//! because he was weak, he was losing because four fifths of his boards were
//! empty. Hand-authoring seventy-odd placements across five grids is not
//! something to do in a text editor.
//!
//! The rule the search has to respect is `MonsterSpec::unassembled`: every
//! chunk a creature's gear is cut into must come together into a real item. A
//! player may seat loose pieces for their flat stats - the friend's board does
//! it twelve times - but a creature may not.
