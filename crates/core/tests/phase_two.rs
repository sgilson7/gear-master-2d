//! The Phase-2 exit, said as assertions.

//! Phase 2 is the mission's content phase and its rule is that content is
//! *data*: every event, town, dungeon, reward and word in the spec exists and
//! is reachable, and not one creature has been dressed. E6.8 is four claims and
//! this file is four claims.
//!
//! The fourth is the one worth saying out loud. Every creature the mission adds
//! is still a `MonsterFrame` - a name, a band, a theme and a note - and the
//! frame lint is still red on purpose. It goes green in M17, by hand, in
//! `make pack`, after M16 has re-pinned the rating that decides what
//! `stepped_component` hands every monster on three of the four settings.
