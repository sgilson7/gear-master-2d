//! The three primitives the interaction fabric is built from: watchers that
//! count, the diagonal relation, and fused pools.
//!
//! These tests build their item profiles by hand rather than by packing a
//! board: what is under test is the mechanic, not the gear. That was because
//! nothing in the catalogue carried any of these when they were written, and it
//! stays that way now that pieces do, because a test that reaches for whichever
//! watcher happens to exist is a test that changes meaning under a sweep.
//!
//! The catalogue has since caught up unevenly - fifteen pieces watch, seven see
//! diagonally, one is terrain, and **nothing fuses a pool**. Fusion is the one
//! primitive that still exists only here.
