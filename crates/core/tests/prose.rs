//! What the game is allowed to sound like.
//!
//! Every scene in this game is written in one voice, taken from the book the
//! theme comes from: a grave, patiently-observed situation with a mundane
//! errand underneath it, and rules explained carefully for insane things. A
//! monastery at the top of a frozen mountain, three days of climbing, the
//! Master's grave question - and the answer is a delivery, and the complaint
//! is about pickles.
//!
//! What that voice is *not* is the thing this file exists to catch. Left alone,
//! the prose drifted into a register that withholds every noun ("something is
//! running", "the square thing", "what a cart becomes"), sets mood in place of
//! fact, and closes every paragraph on the same deflating half-sentence. It
//! reads like atmosphere and carries no information, and nine events in a row
//! of it reads like one event nine times.
//!
//! These are cheap mechanical proxies, not literary judgement: a sentence can
//! pass all of them and still be bad. Three of them - the hedging phrases, the
//! scene naming nothing, and the mood titles - fail outright on the prose that
//! was here before this file existed, which is what they were written from.
//! The rest are guards rather than detectors: they hold today and would catch
//! the drift coming back.
