//! The Manse chain, walked in the order a player meets it.
//!
//! `chain.rs` proves each station of the chain opens the next, and it proves it
//! by standing the run at each door in turn - which means it sets `run.rung`
//! **backwards** between two of them. `the_chain_can_be_finished_in_one_run_in_either_mode`
//! answers THE LOCKED GATE at rung 26 and then puts the run back at rung 25 to
//! meet the Manse. That is a true claim about the doors and it is not a claim
//! about the road: nothing in this suite walked the chain forward.
//!
//! It matters here because the chain is the first thing a goal-conditioned
//! agent is being trained to finish (`design/HANDOFF-two-agents.md` §C7), and
//! an agent trained against a chain that cannot be walked in rung order would
//! be learning a road the game does not have.
//!
//! So: one run, rung one upwards, every fight won by fiat, every chain door
//! answered the moment it stands, and nothing ever set backwards.
//!
//! ## The deadline, which is the thing worth pinning
//!
//! THE MANSE is `Unlock::Hidden` and stands `after: 24`. `town::between` finds
//! the town whose `after + 1` **equals** the rung, and `Run::settle` asks it
//! once, the moment rung index 24 is cleared. So the reveal has one rung to
//! land on and the run walks past the house for ever afterwards.
//!
//! Three bands come out of that and all three are measured below:
//!
//! | first word arrives | what happens |
//! |---|---|
//! | up to rung 25 | both doors answered, the gate stands, the class is won |
//! | rungs 26 to 29 | both doors answered, the town revealed, **no gate** |
//! | rung 30 onward | the astronomer's own window has shut; nothing answered |
//!
//! The middle band is the one to know about. A run there answers every door on
//! the chain, takes the correct choice at both, and puts the town on the map -
//! and cannot reach it. Three of the four tiers a quest spec pays
//! (`HANDOFF-two-agents.md` §3.6) pay in full on a run that cannot finish,
//! which is what makes "the finish is worth more than every step combined" a
//! rule about this game rather than a general worry.
//!
//! `crates/lab/src/bin/qchain.rs` is the printer these numbers were read off.
