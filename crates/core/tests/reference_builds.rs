//!
//! E6.5: **THE UNWOUND is harder than Francis.** At least two of the three
//! builds that beat Francis lose to it unadapted, and a fourth written with
//! Deflection and Insight in mind wins. That is not a claim you can make about
//! a boss by looking at it - it is a measurement across four boards, and this
//! file is where the four live.
//!
//! Three of them already existed and are the share codes the baseline harness
//! has measured against since before this mission: a friend's run, a winning
//! run and a perfect one. Codes rather than name lists on purpose - a
//! hand-seated list does not reproduce the build you meant, which this repo
//! has learned three times, and `common::board_from` locks each item as it
//! assembles the way the player did.
//!
//! The fourth is new, and it is a name list because nobody has ever played it:
//! it is written *at* the mind lane, which the shipped builds predate.
