//! Rewards that are not gear.
//!
//! Everything the road hands out was a component, a class, gold or a row -
//! four good answers, all the same shape, and a road with only that vocabulary
//! can say one sentence louder and nothing else.
//!
//! **A run-relic** is worth what the run has done. It is the only piece in the
//! game whose card is different at rung forty from what it was at rung four,
//! and it costs a cell like anything else, so carrying one is a bet on how the
//! run goes rather than a stat you bought.
//!
//! **A crushable** is spent. Nothing else in this game is: everything you own
//! is worn or sold. A crushable breaks a rule once and is gone, which makes
//! carrying one a decision about *when*.
//!
//! The components land with the rest of the mission's catalogue. What is here
//! is the arithmetic, which is testable without them, and the rules the
//! arithmetic hangs off, which are not.
