//! Nothing on the road gets walked past, and now there is a thing that says so.
//!
//! `the_road.rs` holds the doctrine: a fountain, a town gate, an event or a
//! dungeon standing on a rung all stop the next fight from starting. Four
//! separate predicates enforced it and the interface enforced it again in its
//! own words, and the two agreed because somebody kept them agreeing.
//!
//! `Run::road_stack` is that order written down once. The rung's own fight is
//! not in it: the fight is the floor the stack stands on, and it begins when
//! the stack is empty.
//!
//! **Derived rather than stored.** The spec asks for a `Vec<Interrupt>` field
//! pushed on arrival and popped on resolution; it is a function over run state
//! instead, because every entry is already decided by a field that exists and
//! a second copy is a second thing to keep true. Two of this project's bugs
//! were exactly that shape - `at_fountain` counting classes it had not poured,
//! and a fountain schedule keyed on a number something else was adding to.
