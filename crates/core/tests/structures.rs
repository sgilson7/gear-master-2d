//! The doors that are not questions.
//!
//! Everything else in `EVENTS` is a paragraph and two answers. These eight are
//! *shapes*: an inspection that reads the board you are standing in, an auction
//! against a number nobody has seen, a handicap you ask for and are paid for
//! surviving, a passenger who costs cells, a menu made of what you are
//! carrying, a fork whose only question is which half first, and a counter
//! nobody mentioned until it spoke.
//!
//! Three standalone rumour pairs ride with them, and the two classes that come
//! out of those - Unionized, which is the second stacking class in the game,
//! and Showstopper, which is the only thing besides the casino's door that
//! rewards being quick.
