//! The floor graph, proved against a dungeon that is not on the road.
//!
//! A set of points is a decision, and every transition around one - clearing a
//! floor, throwing the lever, leaving, losing, coming back in by a siding - is
//! new machinery that six straight lines cannot exercise. So the fixture is
//! `common::A_YARD`, four rooms with a fork at the top, and the shipped
//! dungeons appear here only where the question is "did this stay the same".
//!
//! Nothing in this file is content. `A_YARD` is not in `DUNGEONS`, its floors
//! are creatures that already exist, and the first `MonsterSpec` this mission
//! writes is M6's.

// ============================================ acceptance criterion 1

/// The full walk, written down: everything a run is told, in order.
///
/// Acceptance criterion 1 names a transcript of one specific walk - buy the
/// timetable, ask for the points, take the Down line and the coal road, feed
/// the Shunter's Orb, take the roundhouse road, feed the Signalman's Orb, be
/// walked through to the water road, and tell Ambrose both lines - piped
/// through the CLI twice and diffed.
///
/// **It is an engine transcript rather than a CLI one, and the reason is the
/// driver rather than the yard.** The chain's first door stands at rung 21 and
/// no board the CLI can build from its own verbs clears twenty rungs: `preset`
/// wins nine of fifty, and there is no `skip` and no way to read a share code
/// in. That is a limitation the driver has had since long before this mission,
/// and it is why M1's replay is an engine transcript too.
///
/// What is here is stronger than the walk itself: every scene, every receipt,
/// every banner and every decision, generated twice inside one test and
/// compared, then compared again against the committed file. A word changing
/// anywhere in the chain fails it and the diff says which word.
