//! What one item did in one fight.
//!
//! A `CombatLog` is a flat transcript. "What did that piece do" needs
//! attribution, attribution needs a rule, and the rule is the one
//! `tests/baseline.rs` has attributed damage by since the slot rewrite:
//! `Event::Activate` precedes its own item's effects and carries the item's
//! index, so a hit belongs to whichever item on that side last activated.
//!
//! These tests are about the rule holding, not about any particular board.
