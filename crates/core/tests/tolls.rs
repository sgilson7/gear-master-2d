//! THE HUNDRED's six figures, and what a tile charges for getting them wrong.
//!
//! A toll reads what a board **does a second** rather than what it has. That
//! is one sentence and it is the whole design: two boards with the same mana
//! on them cross different rivers, because one of them spends it four times as
//! often. Every figure is computed in integers - the division done per item
//! and then summed, which is not the same as summing and then dividing - and
//! no float touches any of it anywhere.
//!
//! Each figure below is **hand-computed in its own assertion**. A test that
//! calls the function it is testing to work out what the answer should be is a
//! test that the function is self-consistent.
