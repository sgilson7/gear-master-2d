//! Everything on the road explains itself, in the engine's own words.
//!
//! Three small systems with one idea behind them: **the engine owns the
//! sentence**. A greyed choice, a rumour in the tray and a receipt after a
//! resolution are all the game saying what just happened or what would have to
//! be true - and if the interface writes those sentences, the CLI has to write
//! them again, the theme layer has nothing to swap, and the three drift.
//!
//! So `Requirement::describe`, `Outcome::describe`, `TownVisit::receipt` and
//! `rumour::conditions_line` all return canonical prose, and the display layer
//! swaps the nouns on the way out.
//!
//! The distinction that matters, and the one that is easy to lose: `unmet` is
//! flavour for the moment *after* you have tried a door - "Merrik does not move
//! the rope, and has not moved it in eleven years" - and `describe` is the
//! plain statement *before* you try. Both ship, and neither replaces the other.
