//! The base game does not speak turtle.
//!
//! Doctrine four says a theme cannot break the game, and it is usually read as
//! a rule about *logic*: `theme.rs` is a lookup and nothing routes decisions
//! through it. There is a second half, quieter and easier to break, and this
//! file is it - **the canonical column has to be canonical**. A base game with
//! Fnorp in its prose is not a base game with a theme on top; it is one game
//! wearing its own name twice, and the plain theme has nothing to fall back
//! *to*.
//!
//! It broke. Every milestone of this mission wrote canonical scenes in the
//! book's voice, because the book's voice is the fun one to write in, and by
//! the end of Phase 2 there were fourteen scenes naming people who exist only
//! in a theme. They are moved: the canonical column names the role and the
//! turtle column names the man, which is what the two columns are for.
//!
//! Shipped as a ratchet, the way `catalog_shape` is - a budget that can only
//! go down, and an `#[ignore]`d target that asserts zero. The remaining
//! entries are **piece names in `CATALOG`**, which is append-only forever and
//! therefore the one place a leak cannot be fixed, only recorded.
