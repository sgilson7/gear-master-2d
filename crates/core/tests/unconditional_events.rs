//! Five that always happen.
//!
//! No rumour, no chain, no flag, no fast kill. A run that touches nothing else
//! in this mission meets all five, which is what they are for: the road is
//! never bare, and the first of them is how a blind run learns the chain is in
//! the game at all.
//!
//! They are also where the mission's **gold rule** is easiest to check. Every
//! figure in this spec is a multiple of the standing rung's bounty rather than
//! a constant, because a constant means one thing at rung four and something
//! else entirely at rung forty: the body's own numbers were two and a half
//! times everything a run had ever seen at one end and one bounty at the
//! other.
