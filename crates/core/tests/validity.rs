//! Can a real build actually get to every door, and through it?
//!
//! The repository's answer to "is this road walkable" has always been
//! `force_win` and `skip_to`: assign a rung, win by fiat, assert the door is
//! standing. That proves the road *graph* and says nothing about whether a
//! build anybody could have can fight its way there
//! (`post-unwinding.md` §10.6, and the gap `design/rl-agent-plan.md` exists to
//! close).
//!
//! This file is the other answer. A **validity solver**: load a strong board,
//! hand it a path, and make it fight. A test passes when the door it was
//! written for was reached, was standing, and was answered - with the fights
//! actually simulated by the oracle rather than granted.
//!
//! Two halves:
//!
//! * `Walk` - the solver. It fights, answers, visits, throws levers and feeds
//!   orbs, and records everything it met. It never calls `force_win`.
//! * The audit - every event in the game with its access conditions spelled
//!   out, and lints over the shapes those conditions can take.
//!
//! What it cannot do is prove a door is *un*reachable: a walk that fails to
//! reach one may be a bad path rather than a shut door. So the lints are about
//! conditions that are impossible in principle, and the walks are existence
//! proofs.
