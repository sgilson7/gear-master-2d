//! `+175 hp` as though they were the same kind of thing.
//!
//! Rootbound Material is the piece that gives it away, because its wording
//! says "each time its item fires" while its colour and its position say
//! otherwise. The other two hundred say nothing at all.
//!
//! The classification lives in `stats.rs` so three surfaces cannot disagree
//! about it. **This file is what stops it being a hand-written table that is
//! right for one mission**: it fires a probe item once and asks the fight
//! which figures moved.
